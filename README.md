# Exploring the Effects of Congenital Heart Disease on Brain MRI Registration

## Description

This project explores the differences in neurodevelopment between patients with Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) and control subjects by comparing brain MRI registration similarity measures between fetal and neonatal scans. I completed this project at the Hillman Academy during the summmer of '23.

## Abstract

Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) patients can have neurocognitive abnormalities. To study differences between CHD and control neurodevelopment, we observed patterns between CHD and control brain MRI registration similarity measures between a fetal and neonatal scan. Our study found patients with CHD have deviations from neurodevelopmental trends. We observed that CHD similarity scores had weaker correlations with fetal age and time duration between the scans than control similarity scores.

## Data

Important Notice: The data used in this project originates from a Pittsburgh hospital and contains sensitive patient information. Due to privacy regulations and ethical considerations, we cannot share the actual data used in the analysis.

Here's how the data structure looks.

## Results

The results of the analysis include statistical comparisons and visualizations that show the differences in neurodevelopment trends between CHD and control subjects. Relevant results and figures can be found in the repository.
